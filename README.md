## I finally understand the point of open source
   all we have to do is keep a documentation of contributions,
   and distribute revenue to them,  
   and document it in a public transaction ledger,  
   whether it's our brain algorithms that produce intuitive judgements on distribution weights,  
   or using an external algorithm to help us decide,  
   because the incremental adjustments to the distribution weights are saved in a collectivey owned database by contributors each time any transaction flows coin into `p1s2e3u4d5o6h7a8s9h/pl`  
 
  
 ### porchLogic is currently flowing 50% of revenue to the following wallets and weights:
 ##### ( pdeudo public-keys for now )
 
 - `weight : 300 , 'wallet' : p1s2e3u4d5o6h7a8s9h/alice`
 - `weight : 200 , 'wallet' : p1s2e3u4d5o6h7a8s9h/bob`
 
 ### as documented publicly here: `p1s2e3u4d5o6h7a8s9h/pl/pub`
 - ( public address on a blockchain )
 - which will show the history of distributions to public-keys as the most transparent 'proof' of the future 
 - because the future is simply a prediction based on known facts of the past
 - facts are a documented transaction between any two entities, as provable by any number of third parties
